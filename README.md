# vuejs_calender
custom_calender_with_vuejs
Create a customize calender plugin with vuejs (For my personal use).

It is hard to get the calender with customization features as I would like to use.
That is why I created this 'Vuejs Calender with features as I desire'.

Tech Stack Using :
Vuejs,
Pinia (State Management Library)

I am planning to update that calender with many features for as you desire customization easily.
If you would like to resquest some new features, you can send merge resquest to me.
I am welcome innovation and creatives minds.
